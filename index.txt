17.
Design three classes STUDENT, EXAM and RESULT. The STUDENT class has data members such as roll no, name. Create a class EXAM by inheriting the STUDENT class. The EXAM class adds data members representing the marks scored in six subjects. Derive the RESULT from the EXAM class and has its own data members such as total marks. WAP to model this relationship.

18.
Create a base class called SHAPE. Use this class to store two double type values. Derive two specific classes called TRIANGLE and RECTANGLE from the base class. Add to the base class, a member function getdata to initialize base class data members and another member function display to compute and display the area of figures. Make display a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Using these three classes design a program that will accept driven of a TRIANGLE or RECTANGLE interactively and display the area.
